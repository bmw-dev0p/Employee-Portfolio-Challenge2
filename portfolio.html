            <aside><p id="aboutMe">Hello my name is Brad Webster and I was born in 1993. I am a student software devolper studying at University of Richmond. My goal is to build a career in app development / video games. I graduated from John Tyler University in Richmond, VA (now Brightpoint College) in 2022. I majored in Information Technology with a minor in Programming. I have held various jobs through my education journey. Most recently, House of Carpet doing rug and runner fabrication work. It has taught me that I like to build things and take pride in my work. My favorite hobbies are going to the gym, skateboarding, and playing video games. My best attributes are discipline, integrity, and problem-solving. I like to adventure and I am looking forward to my next journey.</p></aside>
